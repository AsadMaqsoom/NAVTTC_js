//        Question 6: Leap Year Checker
// Write a JavaScript program that checks if a given year is a leap year or not.A leap year is divisible by 4, but  by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400. Ask the user to enter a year and display whether it is a leap year or not.
let year = parseInt(prompt("Enter Year"));
leapYear = year%4;
if (leapYear===0) {
    document.write("It's a leep Year");
} else {
    document.write("It's not a leep Year");
}

// Question 7: BMI Calculator
// Create a JavaScript program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). The BMI is calculated using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height). Categorize the BMI as follows:

// Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
// Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
// Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9
// Obesity: BMI 30 or greater
// Ask the user to enter their weight and height, then display their BMI category.
